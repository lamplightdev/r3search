R3SEARCH
========

A simple app that makes use of Service Workers to enable offline access. It's a search interface to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) that shows a snippet of an article along with an image if available. The articles and images are cached using a service worker so you can then view them at a later date without needing network access. Granted it's not terribly useful but it should help explore the basic concepts of service workers.
